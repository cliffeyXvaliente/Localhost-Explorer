# localhost4u

This project is made for you web developers who want to have a better UI file on your browser. 

## Installation

Download my project. Unzip the file and put/paste in the items (index.php , style.css & sky.jpg) on your folder htdocs or www / aka. "localhost" (127.0.0.1).
Any other index file you own remove or transfer it to another file or create a folder for it on the localhost page.
Your folders can be kept on the localhost folder. 
Paste the files that you download and have your folders organized. 
To see your folders on your browser, start your AMP and type on the url "localhost".
It may vary to what AMP ( Apache, Mysql, and PHP) you have XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP, MAMP

Thats all :) 

I hope you have a nice day and have fun coding dear Developer :P
